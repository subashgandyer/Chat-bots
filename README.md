# Chat-bots
This repo contains code for creating an intelligent chat bot. This takes in Analyzed sentiments from the restaurant reviews published by users and builds a table of Top dishes in a restaurant, Top restaurants in a cuisine, Top restaurants in an area, Top dishes in a cuisine and so on. These top x's will be sent to the chat user as and when it is required in the conversation.
